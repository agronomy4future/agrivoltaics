Description: The agrivoltaics package simplifies the statistical analysis of experiments 
    conducted in agrivoltaic systems, where agricultural production is integrated with 
    photovoltaic installations. It provides a user-friendly wrapper for fitting linear 
    mixed-effects models using the 'lme4' framework and outputs key diagnostics 
    including variance components and ANOVA tables for research interpretation.
